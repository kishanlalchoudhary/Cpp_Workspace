/* STL -> Standard Template Library

Library of what ?
    Generic Classes and Functions

why use STL ?
    Reuse: Well tested Components
    Time Savings!

Components of STL -> 1)Containers (stores data, use template classes)
                     2)Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Use template functions)
                     3)Iterators (object points to an element in container, Handled just like pointers, Connnects Algo with containers)
                     Iterator moves as instructed by the Algorithm.

STL is used because its a good idea not to Reinvent the wheel.
